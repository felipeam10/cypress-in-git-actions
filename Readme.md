# **Continuous Testing Workflow with Cypress**

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Continuous Testing Workflow** using **Cypress** and **GitHub Actions**, with optional integration to **Cypress Cloud** and **Tesults** for test result reporting.

## **Description**
The goal of this project is to automate end-to-end tests for a login system, execute them in a controlled environment, and generate detailed reports. The workflow supports **multi-browser testing** and provides metrics to enhance the development process.

## **Features**
- Continuous testing workflow with **Cypress**.
- Multi-browser testing (Electron, Chrome, Firefox).
- Integration with **Cypress Cloud** and **Tesults** for result storage and analysis.
- Automated execution via **GitHub Actions**.

## **Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher).
2. **Yarn** (package manager).
3. A **GitHub** account for repository management.
4. Optional: **Cypress Cloud** or **Tesults** accounts for result reporting.
